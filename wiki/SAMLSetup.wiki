#summary How users are authenticated using SAML

= Introduction =

Every node within ORDS which is accessible to end-users acts as a standalone SAML SP to verify the requester’s identity. Only the browser profile will be used. The SAML2PersistentID is used to identify users. Other attributes might optionally be used to pre-populate a registration form. All the SPs metadata is registered with the UK federation.
